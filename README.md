IT KPI (http://itkpi.pp.ua) is the best student IT-community in Ukraine. We've got our clan on codewars.com and decided to make some digests withhin our community members.

Key features of v1.2 are:
- included weekly rating (how much points user scored during last week)
- output into separate HTML page to present TOP 10 of weekly CodeWars warriors

Here are some old projects, used on the early stages of development.
