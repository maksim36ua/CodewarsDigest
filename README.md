# CodewarsDigest
IT KPI codewars.com digest 

Repository with projects for creating digests of IT KPI clan on codewars.com. IT KPI (https://vk.com/itkpi) is the best student IT-community in Ukraine. We have got our clan on codewars.com and decided to make some digests withhin our community members.

v1.2 is under construction. Key features will be:

- web parser will get user info directly from the server
- each week scores will be stored on IT KPI server
- included weekly rating (how much points user scored during last week)

Here are some old projects, used on the early stages of development. Examples of digest itself can be found here: https://goo.gl/rDVMd7
