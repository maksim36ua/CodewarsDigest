# CodewarsDigest v1.2
IT KPI codewars.com digest (http://blog.itkpi.pp.ua/codewars-digest-week-1)

Repository with projects for creating digests of IT KPI clan on codewars.com. Examples of digest itself can be found here: https://goo.gl/rDVMd7

IT KPI (http://itkpi.pp.ua) is the best student IT-community in Ukraine. We've got our clan on codewars.com and decided to make some digests withhin our community members.

Key features of v1.2 are:
- each week scores will be stored on IT KPI server
- included weekly rating (how much points user scored during last week)

Yet to come:
- web parser will get user info directly from the server (now it`s not easy to retrieve data because page updates dynamically)

v1.3 is under construction.
